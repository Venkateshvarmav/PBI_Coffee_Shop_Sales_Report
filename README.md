# Coffee Shop Sales

## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the coffee shop understand their customers better. It helps the coffee know their customers preference. Through different parameters, they get to know their best and worst product in each store location and their busiest day to assign more employees that day & thus they can improve their services. It also lets them know the sales trend and revenue generated each month and comparing them with previous month.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a excel file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset" to check the empty and error percentage.
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present
- Step 5 : Since the data contains various products and categories, thus in order to represent sales, a new visual was added using the bar graph in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 6 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for the month field.
- Step 7 : Metrics table was used as a heat map to show the most and least sales for that particular month
- Step 8 : Bar chart were used to show sales by store location,product category, top 10 product type, sales by hour of the day and sales trend over the preiod.
- Step 9 : Tool Tips are used to show the sales, quanitity sold and total orders using cards and donut charts
- Step 10 : Line graph is used for Spark lines show the trend(sales, qty sold, orders) for the month
- Step 11 : Donut chart is used for showing the sales in weekday against weekend


for creating new columns following DAX expressions were written;

* to extract hour from the transaction time-
HOUR = HOUR(Transactions[transaction_time])

* to identify the sales amount
  Sales = Transactions[unit_price]*Transactions[transaction_qty]

        
- Step 15 : New measure was created to find total the current month sales and previous month sales.`

Following DAX expression was written for the same,

```DAX
Current Month Orders = 
var selected_month = SELECTEDVALUE('Date Table'[Month])
return 
TOTALMTD(CALCULATE([Total Orders],'Date Table'[Month]=selected_month),'Date Table'[Date])
```

Previous Month Orders = 
CALCULATE([Current Month Orders],DATEADD('Date Table'[Date],-1,MONTH))
        
A card visual was used to represent count of customers.


        
 - Step 16 : New measure was created to find  % of customers,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find % of customers,
 
         % Customers = (DIVIDE(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Count of Customers], 129880)*100)
 
 A card visual was used to represent this perecntage.
 
 Snap of % of customers who preferred business class

 - Step 17 : New measure was created to calculate total distance travelled by flights & a card visual was used to represent total distance.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total distance,
 
         Total Distance Travelled = SUM(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Flight Distance])
    
 A card visual was used to represent this total distance.

 - Step 18 : The report was then published to Power BI Service.
